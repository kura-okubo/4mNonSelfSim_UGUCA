# UGUCA extended for analysis of non-self-similar earthquakes

This repository contains the extended version of the spectral-boundary-integral method-based software [**UGUCA**](https://gitlab.com/uguca/uguca) for the analysis in [**4mNonSelfSim_Paper**](https://github.com/kura-okubo/4mNonSelfSim_Paper), where we performed dynamic rupture modeling of non-self-similar earthquakes observed in laboratory experiments.

This version is forked from the `stable` branch of `v1.0` from the [UGUCA](https://gitlab.com/uguca/uguca) repository.  
See the original GitLab repository for the latest version and software information.

## Updated contents

- Linear slip-weakening law with slip-strengthening regime.
- Input files for the case study of laboratory non-self-similar earthquakes.
- Kernel for the rock specimen ($\nu$=0.246).
